Configure Control Socket
////////////////////////

The exporter uses Kea's control socket to request both configuration and 
statistics. Consult the documentation on how to set up the control socket:

- https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arm/dhcp4-srv.html#management-api-for-the-dhcpv4-server
- https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arm/dhcp6-srv.html#management-api-for-the-dhcpv6-server

Permissions
///////////

Kea Exporter needs to be able to read and write on the socket, hence it's
permissions might need to be modified accordingly.
